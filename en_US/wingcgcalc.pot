"Ive used the excelent work of z80 (<a href=\"http://fwcg.3dzone.dk/\">http://"
"fwcg.3dzone.dk/</a>) in the past, but the limitations of one single panel "
"and no forward sweep made me look for multi-panel CG calcs, and Ive found "
"only very old windows programs. Accustomed to the online and direct use of "
"z80's tool, Ive decided to make my own online CG calculator, with forward "
"sweep and multiple panels."

"WingCGCalc is a flying wing CG calculator flexible enough to calculate "
"complex wings, with multiple panels and forward swept. As the percentual "
"position of the MAC for the CG is also configurable, you can use it with "
"standard airplanes (with tail) too, It's only a question of configuring the "
"right amount."
